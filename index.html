                    I learned early on that being an effective problem solver means coming to the solution from various angles.
                    This requires diversity of thought. Diversity that evolves from a wide range of personal interests, 
                    genuine curiosity and a thirst for knowledge.       
                </p>

                    When I was 18, I had a gap year to fill. So I learned to cut hair! Seriously, I was fascinated with the
                    idea of creating shape and form out of something that otherwise just hangs, stands up or curls in uncooperative
                    ways. For me it was another interesting problem to solve. After learning the basics I became largely self-taught
                    and it worked. I even won awards! This was the validation I needed to embark on my career as an artist and engineer.
                    I came to love the fact that “figuring it out for myself” was an effective method of expanding my knowledge and personal growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I take this approach to everything I do, making sure that I learn the fundamental techniques from the best people,
                    then expanding that knowledge though research, practice and peer review. It has taken me from styling hair for stage
                    & screen to becoming a photographer, digital artist, web developer, university lecturer and full-stack engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the challenges and puzzles that coding brings, the continuous learning and the camaraderie that comes from
                    working on a project with a talented team. When I'm not behind a screen, you'll find me hiking, climbing, taking
                    too many pix (no such thing), traveling, exploring San Francisco's legendary (and sometimes obscure) eateries,
                    playing Mario Kart and professing my love for J.K. Rowling. - "We do not need magic to transform our world.
                    We carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already."
